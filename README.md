## Downloading the `.bashrc` File

To download only the `.bashrc` file from the GitHub repository without cloning the entire repo, follow these instructions:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt** based on your operating system.

2. **Use the appropriate command**:

   - **Windows**:
     ```sh
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```

   - **Debian/Ubuntu**:
     ```sh
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```

   - **Arch Linux**:
     ```sh
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```

   - **Red Hat/CentOS**:
     ```sh
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ryan-Millard/bashrc/main/.bashrc
     ```

This will download the `.bashrc` file directly to your current directory.
